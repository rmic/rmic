<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋 I'm rmic</h1>

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Data Engineer** and **MLOps Engineer** with a strong background in interoperable **healthcare data**, and a growing passion for **Geospatial Data, GIS, and drone-based aerial imagery**.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **data engineering, open data, and real-world operational domains**, especially healthcare and emergency services. Recently, I’ve been actively learning and building tools around **GIS, OpenStreetMap, and spatial analysis**, often combining them with my existing experience in data pipelines, automation, and standards.

- 💡 **Core interests**: Data Engineering, MLOps, Health Data Standards, Automation  
- 🌍 **New focus**: Geospatial data, GIS tooling, OpenStreetMap, aerial imagery (drones)
- 🚑 **Applied domains**: Healthcare, emergency medical services, fire & rescue, civil protection
- 🤝 **Open to collaborate** on projects at the crossroads of data engineering, health, and geospatial analysis

## 🌍 Geospatial & GIS Interests

I’m currently exploring how **open geospatial data and GIS tools** can improve the **quality, accuracy, and usability of emergency-related datasets**.

In particular:
- 🗺️ Mapping and validating **ambulance stations, fire stations, and emergency services** in **OpenStreetMap**
- 🧩 Developing **QGIS plugins** to support data conflation, validation, and enrichment workflows
- 🚁 Learning about **drone-based aerial imagery** and its integration into GIS pipelines
- 🔗 Bridging **healthcare & emergency response data** with spatial analysis

One concrete outcome of this work is a **QGIS plugin** I’m currently developing to help improve OSM data quality for emergency infrastructure.
